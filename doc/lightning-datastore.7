.SH NAME
lightning-datastore -- Command for storing (plugin) data
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdatastore\fR \fIkey\fR [\fIstring\fR] [\fIhex\fR] [\fImode\fR] [\fIgeneration\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBdatastore\fR RPC command allows plugins to store data in the
Core Lightning database, for later retrieval.
.PP
\fIkey\fR is an array of values (though a single value is treated as a
one-element array), to form a hierarchy.  Using the first element of
the key as the plugin name (e.g. \fC[ \(dqsummary\(dq ]\fR) is recommended.
A key can either have children or a value, never both: parents are
created and removed automatically.
.PP
\fImode\fR is one of \(dqmust-create\(dq (default, fails if it already exists),
\(dqmust-replace\(dq (fails if it doesn't already exist),
\(dqcreate-or-replace\(dq (never fails), \(dqmust-append\(dq (must already exist,
append this to what's already there) or \(dqcreate-or-append\(dq (append if
anything is there, otherwise create).
.PP
\fIgeneration\fR, if specified, means that the update will fail if the
previously-existing data is not exactly that generation.  This allows
for simple atomicity.  This is only legal with \fImode\fR \(dqmust-replace\(dq
or \(dqmust-append\(dq.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, an object is returned, containing:
.IP "\(bu" 2

\fBgeneration\fR (u64, optional): The number of times this has been updated

The following error codes may occur:
- 1202: The key already exists (and mode said it must not)

- 1204: The generation was wrong (and generation was specified)
- 1205: The key has children already.
- 1206: One of the parents already exists with a value.
