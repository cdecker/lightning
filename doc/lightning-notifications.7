disabled.
.PP
Various commands, especially complex and slow ones, offer
notifications which indicate their progress.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fIenable\fR: \fItrue\fR to enable notifications, \fIfalse\fR to disable them.

  \(dqparams\(dq: {
    \(dqenable\(dq: true
  }

.SH NOTIFICATIONS
Notifications are JSON-RPC objects without an \fIid\fR field.  \fIlightningd\fR sends
notifications (once enabled with this \fInotifications\fR command) with a \fIparams\fR
\fIid\fR field indicating which command the notification refers to.
.PP
Implementations should ignore notifications without an \fIid\fR parameter, or
unknown \fImethod\fR.
.PP
Common \fImethod\fRs include:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fImessage\fR: param \fImessage\fR: a descriptional string indicating something
which occurred relating to the command. Param \fIlevel\fR indicates the level,
as per lightning-getlog(7): \fIinfo\fR and \fIdebug\fR are typical.
.if n \
.sp -1
.if t \
.sp -0.25v
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fIprogress\fR: param \fInum\fR and \fItotal\fR, where \fInum\fR starts at 0 and is always
less than \fItotal\fR. Optional param \fIstage\fR with fields \fInum\fR and \fItotal\fR,
indicating what stage we are progressing through.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, an empty object is returned.
.PP
On success, if \fIenable\fR was \fItrue\fR, notifications will be forwarded
from then on.
.PP
On failure, one of the following error codes may be returned:
.IP "\(bu" 2
-32602: Error in given parameters.
