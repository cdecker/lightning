lightningd (0.6.3-1) stable; urgency=low

  * JSON API: New command check checks the validity of a JSON API call without running it.
  * JSON API: getinfo now returns num_peers num_pending_channels, num_active_channels and num_inactive_channels fields.
  * JSON API: use \n\n to terminate responses, for simplified parsing (pylightning now relies on this)
  * JSON API: fundchannel now includes an announce option, when false it will keep channel private. Defaults to true.
  * JSON API: listpeers's channels now includes a private flag to indicate if channel is announced or not.
  * Plugins: experimental plugin support for lightningd, including option passthrough and JSON-RPC passthrough.
  * JSON API: pay and decodepay accept and ignore lightning: prefixes.

  * pylightning: Support for pre-2-newline JSON-RPC (<= 0.6.2 lightningd) is deprecated.

  * JSON API: commands are once again read even if one hasn't responded yet (broken in 0.6.2).
  * Protocol: allow lnd to send update_fee before funding_locked.

  * JSON API: listpeers has new field scratch_txid: the latest tx in channel.
  * JSON API: listpeers has new array htlcs: the current live payments.
  * JSON API: listchannels has two new fields: message_flags and channel_flags. This replaces flags.

lightningd (0.6.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Protocol: gossipd now deliberately delays spamming with channel_update.
  * Protocol: liveness ping when we commit changes but peer is idle: speeds up failures and reduces forced closures.
  * Protocol: option_data_loss_protect now supported to protect peers against being out-of-date.
  * JSON API: Added description to invoices and payments (#1740).
  * JSON API: getinfo has new fields alias and color.
  * JSON API: listpeers has new fields global_features and local_features.
  * JSON API: listnodes has new field global_features.
  * JSON API: ping command to send a ping to a connected peer.
  * JSON API: feerates command to retrieve current fee estimates.
  * JSON API: withdraw and fundchannel can be given manual feerate.
  * Config: --conf option to set config file.
  * Documentation: Added CHANGELOG.md
  * pylightning: RpcError now has method and payload fields.
  * Sending lightningd a SIGHUP will make it reopen its log-file, if any.
  * Protocol: Fee estimates are now smoothed over time, to avoid sudden jumps.
  * Config: You can only announce one address if each type (IPv4, IPv6, TORv2, TORv3).
  * lightning-cli: the help command for a specific command now runs the man command.
  * HSM: The HSM daemon now maintains the per-peer secrets, rather than handing them out. It's still lax in what it signs though.
  * connectd: A new daemon lightning_connectd handles connecting to/from peers, instead of gossipd doing that itself. lightning_openingd now handles peers immediately, even if they never actually open a channel.
  * Test: python-xdist is now a dependency for tests.
  * Logging: JSON connections no longer spam debug logs.
  * Routing: We no longer consider channels that are not usable either because of their capacity or their htlc_minimum_msat parameter (#1777)
  * We now try to connect to all known addresses for a peer, not just the one given or the first one announced.
  * Crash logs are now placed one-per file like crash.log.20180822233752
  * We will no longer allow withdrawing funds or funding channels if we do not have a fee estimate (eg. bitcoind not synced); use new feerate arg.
  * JSON API: listpeers results no long have alias and color fields; they're in listnodes (we used to internally merge the information).
  * JSON API: listpeers will never have state field (it accidentally used to exist and set to GOSSIPING before we opened a channel). connected will indicate if we're connected, and the channels array indicates individual channel states (if any).
  * Config: default-fee-rate is no longer available; use explicit feerate option if necessary.
  * Removed all Deprecated options from 0.6.
  * Protocol: node_announcement multiple addresses are correctly ordered and uniquified.
  * Protocol: if we can't estimate feerate, be almost infinitely tolerant of other side setting fees to avoid unilateral close.
  * JSON API: listnodes: now displays node aliases and colors even if they don't advertise a network address
  * JSON API: fundchannel all: now restricts to 2^24-1 satoshis rather than failing.
  * JSON API: listnodes: now correctly prints addresses if more than one is advertised.
  * Config: bind-addr of a publicly accessible network address was announced.
  * When we reconnect and have to retransmit failing HTLCs, the errors weren't encrypted by us.
  * lightningd_config man page is now installed by make install.
  * Fixed crash when shutting down during opening a channel (#1737)
  * Don't lose track of our own output when applying penalty transaction (#1738)
  * Protocol: channel_update inside error messages now refers to correct channel.
  * Stripping type prefix from channel_updates that are nested in an onion reply to be compatible with eclair and lnd (#1730).
  * Failing tests no longer delete the test directory, to allow easier debugging (Issue: #1599)

lightningd (0.6-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * While there are far too many new features in the 0.6 release to list, the following are the most interesting and impactful: Lightweight nodes: Previous releases required a full bitcoind node running alongside c-lightning, to provide access to the Bitcoin network. Thisrelease still requires the bitcoin-cli utility to be present, but it can now talk to remote nodes as well, including some lightweight nodes such as spruned. This makes it possible to run a c-lightning node on Raspberry Pis as well as other low-powered devices.
  * The gossip protocol has been updated to use a more lightweight bandwidth mechanism that asks for specific information, rather than exchanging full network views as the previous release did. This is particularly important for low-powered and mobile devices that would otherwise spend a lot of bandwidth and energy downloading and verifying information they already have.
  * API stability: The c-lightning JSON-RPC interface and supporting libraries have been redesigned in order to minimize changes in future releases. This API stability should make it easy for other projects to build on top of c-lightning because we will support this version of the API for the foreseeable future, maintaining backward compatibility, should we introduce any changes.
  * Wallet and sync: c-lightning now includes a full-fledged wallet that manages both on-chain and off-chain funds. There is no more raw transaction handling! All funds are automatically tracked and returned to the internalwallet as soon as possible, with no user interaction required. In addition the blockchain tracking now maintains an internal view of the blockchain,ending long blockchain rescans.
  * TOR support: c-lightning now supports connecting to nodes over the TOR network, auto-registering as a hidden service, and accepting incoming connections over TOR.
  * The payment logic has undergone a major overhaul to support automatic retries for routing failures, randomization of route selection, and better feedback about the current state of a payment.
  * And as always: performance, performance, performance.
